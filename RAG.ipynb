Read all instructions carefully before using the coffee-mill.2 To protect against risk of fire, electrical shock and injury to persons, do not immerse cord, plug or\\nappliance in water or other liquids.\\n3. The appliance is not intended for use by persons (including children) with reduced physical, sensory\\nor mental capacities, or lack of experience and knowledge, unless they have been given supervisionor instruction concerning use of the appliance by a person responsible for their safety. Childrenshould be supervised to ensure that they do not play with the appliance.\\n4. Close supervision is necessary when  any appliance is used by or near children.5. Do not remove the lid until the blade has stopped completely. After releasing the push button the\\nblade will come to a stop within 2 to 3 seconds.\\n6. Unplug from the outlet when not in use, before putting on or taking off parts, and before cleaning.\\nAllow to cool down before putting on or taking off parts, before cleaning the appliance, and beforestoring.\\n7. Do not operate any appliance with a damaged cord or plug or after the appliance malfunctions, or\\nhas been dropped or damaged in any manner. Return the appliance to the nearest authorizedDe‚ÄôLonghi service center for examination, repair or adjustment.\\n8. To reduce the risk of injury do not drape cord over the counter top or table top where it can be pul-\\nled on by children or tripped over unintentionally.\\n9. Do not let the cord hang over the edge of the table or counter, or touch hot surfaces. A short power\\ncord is provided to reduce risks resulting from becoming entangled in or tripping over a longer cord.Longer, detachable power supply cords or extension cords are available and may be used if care isexercised in their use. If an extension cord is used, the marked electrical rating should be at least asgreat as the electrical rating of the appliance.  The longer cord should be arranged so that it will notdrape over the counter-top or table top where it can be pulled on by children or tripped over.\\n10. Do not use outdoors.11. Do not place on or near a hot gas or electric burner, or in a heated oven.12. To disconnect, remove plug from wall outlet. Do not yank cord, instead grasp plug and pull to di-\\nsconnect.\\n13. Do not use the appliance for othe than intended use. Never chop ice or use the coffee mill other than\\nas described in the instructions.\\n14. Check grinding chamber foor presence of foreign obects before using.15. Blades are sharp. Handle them carefully.16. Make certain the voltage of the appliance is in accordance with your domestic supply.17. This appliance is for household use only. Any servicing other than cleaning and user maintenance\\nshould be performed by the nearest authorized  De‚ÄôLonghi Service Center.Do not immerse the appliance in water.To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, do not dismantle the appliance. Repair should be doneby an authorized De‚ÄôLonghi Service Center only.\\n18. The use of attachments not recommended or sold by the manufacturer may cause fire, electric shock\\nor injury.\\n19. Avoid contacting moving parts.20. This appliance has a polarized plug (one blade is wider than the other). To reduce the risk of electric\\nshock, this plug is intended to fit into a polarized outlet only one way. If the plug does not fit fully inthe outlet, reverse the plug. If it still does not fit, contact a qualified electrician. Do not attempt to mo-dify the plug in any way.\\nSAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS5GB\\nFR\\nES\\nITDESCRIPTION OF THE\\nAPPLIANCE\\nA.Cleaning brush\\nB.Coffee bean container‚Äôs cover\\nC.Coffee bean container\\nD.Cable winder\\nE.Cups number selection ring (KG49 only)\\nF.Indicator for degree of grinding (KG49 only)\\nPRELIMINARY CHECKS\\nControls after transport\\nAfter removing the packaging, make sure the pro-\\nduct is complete and undamaged and that all ac-cessories are present.Do not use the appliance if it is visibly damaged.Contact the technical service center. \\nConnecting the appliance\\nImportant! Check that the power supply\\nvoltage corresponds to the value indicated on therating plate on the bottom of the appliance. \\nUSING THE APPLIANCE\\n\\x81 Place the appliance on a flat surface.\\x81 Unscrew the lid in a counter-clockwise di-\\nrection and lift it off (fig. 1).\\n\\x81 Fill the container with the desired amount of\\ncoffee beans (fig. 2).\\n\\x81 Screw the lid in a clockwise direction, rota-\\nting it until it can't be turned anymore (fig.3). A safety device will not allow operation ifthe lid is not inserted correctly. Do not attempt operation without the cover\\nbeing in place.\\n\\x81 Pull out the length of cord required and plug\\ninto the socket (fig. 4).\\n\\x81 In select models (KG49), turn the cups num-\\nber selection ring (E) to the number of cupsyou wish to grind (fig. 5). The amount of cof-fee will change depending on individual taste,the type and roasting of the coffee beans andthe degree of grinding selected: never fill overthe MAX level stamped on the coffee beancontainer.\\n\\x81 Press the cover to start the coffee mill (fig.\\n6) and keep it pressed until the right grindinglevel is obtained. \\nDo not operate this appliance continuouslyfor more than 60 seconds. Allow applianceto cool down for 10 minutes before usingagain. \\n\\x81 In models with indicator lights showing the\\ndegree of grinding ( F) (coarse, medium,\\nfine), press the cover and then release itwhen the indicator lights up relative to the re-quired degree of grinding. Remember thatwhen the cover is released, even for a se-cond, the appliance resets and starts grin-ding again as if there were whole beansinside.\\nTIPS\\n\\x81 Always keep the lid of the coffee bean con-\\ntainer tightly closed to keep in all the flavorand aroma of the coffee beans.\\n\\x81 Only grind the amount of coffee required.\\x81 Do not overfill the coffee bean container.\\nAs an indication, calculate a tablespoon ofcoffee beans per cup (e.g. 4 spoonfuls of cof-fee beans for 4 cups of coffee). The idealamount depends on individual taste and willbe discovered through the use of the ma-chine.\\n\\x81 For models with indicators lights showing\\nthe degree of grinding, remember that:COARSE grinding is ideal for percolators;MEDIUM is ideal for mocha coffeepots anddrip coffee makers;FINE is ideal for espresso coffee makers.\\n\\x81 To ensure that you always have the best qua-\\nlity in terms of freshness, always clean theappliance after each use, especially if coffeeis ground after grinding other products (e.g.spices). However it is inadvisable to grindoily beans (e.g. peanuts) or products that aretoo hard (e.g. rice).CLEANING\\nDanger of electric shock! Before perfor-\\nming any cleaning operations, the machine mustbe turned off and disconnected from the poweroutlet. Never immerse the appliance in water.\\n\\x81 Unplug from the outlet.\\n\\x81 Wash the cover with water and mild soap.\\nThen thoroughly rinse and dry. \\n\\x81 To clean easily, remove the coffee bean con-\\ntainer completely by turning it and unscre-wing it clockwise until it is released, then liftit off  (fig. 7).\\n\\x81 Remove the coffee grounds residues with the\\nprovided brush (fig. 8). Never immerse thecoffee bean container in water to avoid da-mages.\\n\\x81 To replace the coffee bean container, rotate\\ncounterclockwise until it locks in position.\\n\\x81 Clean the outside of the appliance with a soft\\ncloth. \\n\\x81 When you store after use of the appliance,\\nwind the cable on the cable winder ( D).\\n67GB\\nFR\\nES\\nITThis warranty applies to all products with De‚ÄôLonghi or Kenwood brand names.\\nLIMITED WARRANTY\\nWhat does the warranty cover?\\nWe warrant each appliance to be free from defects in material and workmanship.

      "PASSAGE: 4IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS When using electrical appliances, basic safety precautions should always be followed to reduce the risk of fire, electric shock, and/pr injury to persons including the following:1. Read all instructions carefully before using the coffee-mill.2 To protect against risk of fire, electrical shock and injury to persons, do not immerse cord, plug or appliance in water or other liquids. 3. The appliance is not intended for use by persons (including children) with reduced physical, sensory or mental capacities, or lack of experience and knowledge, unless they have been given supervisionor instruction concerning use of the appliance by a person responsible for their safety. Childrenshould be supervised to ensure that they do not play with the appliance. 4. Close supervision is necessary when  any appliance is used by or near children.5. Do not remove the lid until the blade has stopped completely. After releasing the push button the blade will come to a stop within 2 to 3 seconds. 6. Unplug from the outlet when not in use, before putting on or taking off parts, and before cleaning. Allow to cool down before putting on or taking off parts, before cleaning the appliance, and beforestoring. 7. Do not operate any appliance with a damaged cord or plug or after the appliance malfunctions, or has been dropped or damaged in any manner. Return the appliance to the nearest authorizedDe‚ÄôLonghi service center for examination, repair or adjustment. 8. To reduce the risk of injury do not drape cord over the counter top or table top where it can be pul- led on by children or tripped over unintentionally. 9. Do not let the cord hang over the edge of the table or counter, or touch hot surfaces. A short power cord is provided to reduce risks resulting from becoming entangled in or tripping over a longer cord.Longer, detachable power supply cords or extension cords are available and may be used if care isexercised in their use. If an extension cord is used, the marked electrical rating should be at least asgreat as the electrical rating of the appliance.  The longer cord should be arranged so that it will notdrape over the counter-top or table top where it can be pulled on by children or tripped over. 10. Do not use outdoors.11. Do not place on or near a hot gas or electric burner, or in a heated oven.12. To disconnect, remove plug from wall outlet. Do not yank cord, instead grasp plug and pull to di- sconnect. 13. Do not use the appliance for othe than intended use. Never chop ice or use the coffee mill other than as described in the instructions. 14. Check grinding chamber foor presence of foreign obects before using.15. Blades are sharp. Handle them carefully.16. Make certain the voltage of the appliance is in accordance with your domestic supply.17. This appliance is for household use only. Any servicing other than cleaning and user maintenance should be performed by the nearest authorized  De‚ÄôLonghi Service Center.Do not immerse the appliance in water.To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, do not dismantle the appliance. Repair should be doneby an authorized De‚ÄôLonghi Service Center only. 18. The use of attachments not recommended or sold by the manufacturer may cause fire, electric shock or injury. 19. Avoid contacting moving parts.20. This appliance has a polarized plug (one blade is wider than the other). To reduce the risk of electric shock, this plug is intended to fit into a polarized outlet only one way. If the plug does not fit fully inthe outlet, reverse the plug. If it still does not fit, contact a qualified electrician. Do not attempt to mo-dify the plug in any way.

Connecting the appliance Important! Check that the power supply voltage corresponds to the value indicated on therating plate on the bottom of the appliance.  USING THE APPLIANCE ¬Å Place the appliance on a flat surface.¬Å Unscrew the lid in a counter-clockwise di- rection and lift it off (fig. 1). ¬Å Fill the container with the desired amount of coffee beans (fig. 2). ¬Å Screw the lid in a clockwise direction, rota- ting it until it can't be turned anymore (fig.3). A safety device will not allow operation ifthe lid is not inserted correctly. Do not attempt operation without the cover being in place. ¬Å Pull out the length of cord required and plug into the socket (fig. 4). ¬Å In select models (KG49), turn the cups num- ber selection ring (E) to the number of cupsyou wish to grind (fig. 5). The amount of cof-fee will change depending on individual taste,the type and roasting of the coffee beans andthe degree of grinding selected: never fill overthe MAX level stamped on the coffee beancontainer. ¬Å Press the cover to start the coffee mill (fig. 6) and keep it pressed until the right grindinglevel is obtained.  Do not operate this appliance continuouslyfor more than 60 seconds. Allow applianceto cool down for 10 minutes before usingagain.  ¬Å In models with indicator lights showing the degree of grinding ( F) (coarse, medium, fine), press the cover and then release itwhen the indicator lights up relative to the re-quired degree of grinding. Remember thatwhen the cover is released, even for a se-cond, the appliance resets and starts grin-ding again as if there were whole beansinside. TIPS ¬Å Always keep the lid of the coffee bean con- tainer tightly closed to keep in all the flavorand aroma of the coffee beans. ¬Å Only grind the amount of coffee required.¬Å Do not overfill the coffee bean container. As an indication, calculate a tablespoon ofcoffee beans per cup (e.g. 4 spoonfuls of cof-fee beans for 4 cups of coffee). The idealamount depends on individual taste and willbe discovered through the use of the ma-chine. ¬Å For models with indicators lights showing the degree of grinding, remember that:COARSE grinding is ideal for percolators;MEDIUM is ideal for mocha coffeepots anddrip coffee makers;FINE is ideal for espresso coffee makers. ¬Å To ensure that you always have the best qua- lity in terms of freshness, always clean theappliance after each use, especially if coffeeis ground after grinding other products (e.g.spices). However it is inadvisable to grindoily beans (e.g. peanuts) or products that aretoo hard (e.g. rice).CLEANING Danger of electric shock! Before perfor- ming any cleaning operations, the machine mustbe turned off and disconnected from the poweroutlet. Never immerse the appliance in water. ¬Å Unplug from the outlet. ¬Å Wash the cover with water and mild soap. Then thoroughly rinse and dry.  ¬Å To clean easily, remove the coffee bean con- tainer completely by turning it and unscre-wing it clockwise until it is released, then liftit off  (fig. 7). ¬Å Remove the coffee grounds residues with the provided brush (fig. 8).

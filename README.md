# Generative AI Essentials Tutorial

## Overview

Welcome to this tutorial on **Generative AI**! In this repository, Iâ€™ve summarized the key concepts that everyone should learn to understand and effectively use generative AI technologies. These essential components will help you develop the skills needed to build powerful and efficient AI models, no matter your background or job role.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - **What is it?**  
     Learn how to design and optimize prompts to get the best results from generative AI models. Crafting the right prompt is crucial for obtaining accurate and contextually relevant outputs.
   - **Importance:**  
     Effective prompt engineering is a key skill that enhances the performance of AI models in any domain.

### 2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - **What is RAG?**  
     Understand the concept of **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), where the model retrieves relevant data from a knowledge base to improve the quality of generated responses.
   - **Use Case:**  
     Learn how to use RAG systems for context-aware content generation by integrating external knowledge sources.

### 3. **Similarity Score**
   - **What is it?**  
     Discover how similarity scoring helps determine how similar two data points are, which is critical for tasks like document search, clustering, and content generation.
   - **Importance:**  
     Similarity scores are widely used in AI to measure relevance and identify patterns in large datasets.

### 4. **Function Calling in Generative AI**
   - **What is Function Calling?**  
     Learn how generative AI models can call external functions or APIs to enhance their capabilities and interact with real-world data in real-time.
   - **Use Case:**  
     This expands the functionality of AI by enabling it to execute external actions or retrieve live data as part of the response generation process.

### 5. **Classification of Data Using Embeddings and Deep Learning Models**
   - **What is it?**  
     Understand how embeddings and deep learning models can be used for the classification of data. This process helps the model understand complex data patterns and categorize information accurately.
   - **Use Case:**  
     Learn how to use embeddings for tasks like text classification, image recognition, and sentiment analysis.
